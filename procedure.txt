The steps taken to complete the assignment :
- First the csv files are loaded.
- A dictionary is made to hold the similar words to each topic for categorizing the questions ( related words can also be scraped from the web which I considered to be out of scope for this assignment)
- Each question is categorized into one or more category using the dictionary. For each question, an entry is made in the 'topic' column (Since the labelled data is not available, a classifier can not be made)
- Sorting the questions based on the frequency given by 'Unnamed: 0' column
- A new csv file is made according to the required output format.
