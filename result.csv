1,Operating System,caching,The data dictionary cache is stored in an area in SGA called the shared pool. This will allow sharing of parsed SQL statements among concurrent users.
2,Operating System,caching,The data dictionary cache is stored in an area in SGA called the Shared SQL Pool. This will allow sharing of parsed SQL statements among concurrent users.
3,Operating System,security,You are developing security policy for your SQL Servers and have all of the data entry clerks needing access to a series of tables. You create a Data Entry role and assign the proper permissions as well as add the users.
4,Operating System,deadlock,"Questions were fired one after another from deadlock  critical section  memory management. He then again shifted to SQL and gave simple queries to write. I got confused in two and I politely said ""I do not know Sir"". Rest I was confident that I was correct. He tried to confuse me but I remained intact to my points. He then asked basics of C- pointers and functions  preprocessors directives and their functions."
5,Operating System,buffering,The On-line Redo Log is a set of tow or more on-line redo files that record all committed changes made to the database. Whenever a transaction is committed  the corresponding redo entries temporarily stores in redo log buffers of the SGA are written to an on-line redo log file by the background process LGWR. The on-line redo log files are used in cyclical fashion.
6,Operating System,caching,a) Data Base Writer(DBWR) :: Data Base Writer Writes Modified blocks from Database buffer cache to Data Files.This is required since the data is not written whenever a transaction is commited.

8,Operating System,deadlock,This level of error severity indicates a transaction deadlock error.
9,Operating System,deadlock,Q- What is deadlock and blocking with respect to the transaction?
10,Operating System,deadlock,Deadlock  graph(2)  error detection in which layer of OSI find no: of
11,Operating System,deadlock,This level of error severity indicates a transaction deadlock error.
12,Operating System,deadlock,17. Which of the following is not condition having a deadlock resource previous granted  can be forcebly taken away from a process
13,Operating System,deadlock,8)  deadlocks  and i told abt 4 conditons of deadlocks also
14,Operating System,deadlock,Operating systems:  resource allocation  write bankers algorithm  safety algorithm  deadlocks  how to resolve them  conditions for dead lock etc.
15,Operating System,deadlock,Q 12. The following conditions are necessary for a deadlock
16,Operating System,deadlock,12. Many problems like A needs 5 resources and B needs 6 resources of same type  then minimum resources needed so that deadlock will not occur?
17,Operating System,deadlock,21.what is deadlock n different mechanism to avoid it
18,Operating System,deadlock,Then they asked deadlock-i answered
19,Operating System,security,? See the figure numbers correctly They ask question by just giving the figure no. And also the calculations may also be asked. The results were declared and I cleared the round Technical interview The techinal interviewer asked me to write few programs on c And he almost asked all the topics like Operation systems Information security- authentication authourisation DBMS Data structures Java Prepare well for all the topics HR Its very simple.
20,Operating System,security,Me: security  platform independent...
21,Database Management System,sql,* SQL query for Insertion  Deletion and Updation.
22,Database Management System,sql,It is the method of dividing a table which would enable a quick reference.  SAP uses fact file partitioning to improve performance. We can partition only at  0CALMONTH or 0FISCPER. Table partitioning helps to run the report faster as data  is stored in the relevant partitions. Also table maintenance becomes easier.  Oracle  Informix  IBM DB2/390 supports table partitioning while SAP DB   Microsoft SQL Server  IBM DB2/400 do not support table portioning.
23,Database Management System,sql,2. RDBMS:  questions based on codd's rules  normalization  sql queries
24,Object_oriented_programing,Object,In SQL Server 2005  which of the following schema changes are supported for the publication objects of a replicated database?
25,Object_oriented_programing,jdbc,When testing connectivity in SQL Server  you use which utility in conjunction with the readpipe utility to establish a connection?
26,Object_oriented_programing,Object,DDL triggers cannot be signed  but all the other objects can.
27,Object_oriented_programing,Inheritance,One additional key difference between interfaces and abstract classes (possibly the most important one) is that multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class  but only one abstract class can be inherited by any single class.
28,Object_oriented_programing,Inheritance,The questions were very simple like about the company  net revenue  location of headquarters  CEO  our mini project  any key role played in mini project  any innovative ideas you came up with  basic questions on C and JAVA like what are the three OOP principles  what is encapsulation  what is inheritance. Etc.
29,Object_oriented_programing,encapsulation,The questions were very simple like about the company  net revenue  location of headquarters  CEO  our mini project  any key role played in mini project  any innovative ideas you came up with  basic questions on C and JAVA like what are the three OOP principles  what is encapsulation  what is inheritance. Etc.
30,Object_oriented_programing,thread,Imagine this scenario: I/O completion ports are communictaions ports which take handles to files  sockets  or any other I/O. When a Read or Write is submitted to them  they cache the data (if necessary)  and attempt to take the request to completion. Upon error or completion  they call a user-supplied function to let the users application know that that particular request has completed. They work asynchronously  and can process an unlimited number of simultaneous requests. Design the implementation and thread models for I/O completion ports. Remember to take into account multi-processor machines.
31,Object_oriented_programing,Object,The object?s state (values)How does output caching work in ASP.NET?
32,Object_oriented_programing,thread,OS-CPU Scheduling algorithms  Threads with Life Cycle  Paging concepts.
